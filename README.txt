Minecraft modding tutorial using Forge to create a set of red diamond tools.

This was done with Forge after downloading the framework from http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/

It will go over setting up the mod, creating a new Red Diamond tool material, creating a new Red Diamond item, 
creating an ore that drops the Red Diamond item, smelting & crafting recipes that use the Red Diamond, and 
creating a set of Red Diamond Tools
