Minecraft modding tutorial using Forge to create a set of red diamond tools.

This was done with Forge after downloading the framework 
from http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/

It will go over setting up the mod, creating a new Red Diamond tool material, 
creating a new Red Diamond item, creating an ore that drops the Red Diamond item, 
smelting & crafting recipes that use the Red Diamond, and creating a set of 
Red Diamond Tools.  It will also cover creating textures, both single and 
multi-textures.
